# Linux-ping-servers

A Linuxping.sh file has been created which reads in a text file “servers.txt” with IP addresses and uses the ping command to find out alive machines on
the network. The purpose of this project is to simulate a Manager server which will test connectivity with subsytems. This Main Manager will run (or autorun periodically) this batch file creating a Report called PingResult and a ErrorLogs files.
